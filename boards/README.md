## Board Variants

The board is available in two mounting styles: **Solder** (through-hole, thinner) and **Solderless** (female header, no soldering).

Both styles are available in two editions: **Basic** (display + touch) and **Gamepad** (display + touch + buttons + joysticks + audio).

All four variants use the same Gerber files but differ in component placement. See full details, feature tables, and images: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md).
